<h3> Bear Moon Photography </h3> <br>

<p> The Bear Moon Photography company was created in 2016 with the aim of providing quality nature photography 
    service for use in nature magazines. The Home page displays a few of the photographs which have recieved 
    recognition for use in National Geographic's 2019 March 'Nature' magazine. </p> 

<p> My name is Don, I am a 26 year-old photographer of the company which I set up. I may be the only photographer
    of the company, but my work speaks for the quality I provide. I travel around the world a significant amount to 
    capture nature's most awe-inspiring scenes. I chronicle the beauty of planet Earth. I completed my photography
    degree in Standford University, USA in 2014 with a distinction. I have worked as a photography intern at National
    Geographic's 'Nature' magazine for 2 years after graduation before starting up a business and becoming
    self-employed. </p>

<p> Although National Geographic's 'Nature' magazine is my main customer, I am happy to take on short-term contracts
    with any company in need of scenic nature photography. Prices are negotiable according to the kind of photos
    required, the expenses of travel and the any costs associated with obtaining a chance to take the pictures such
    as boat rental, hiking equipment, helicopter rental, etc. My work experience is available on request via contacting
    me. I promise to deliver quality content, if my work is not satisfactory, I am happy fix that with no extra costs
    involved. However, I believe my past work record speaks for itself in terms of the reliability of Bear Moon
    Photography services. </p>
